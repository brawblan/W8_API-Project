# W8_API-Project

## Week 8 Project- Devslopes

This website that fetches and displays real data from the OMdb API.

Requirements for the project:

1. Fetch data from an API and display up to 30 items from that request in your HTML.
2. Display a minimum of 3 values from the data you get back on each HTML item.
3. HTML for each item should be built programmatically (not static HTML. It must be created dynamically).
4. Build a function to add selected items from the array of data to a list.
5. When a user adds an item to the list, the item is removed from the collection of items.
6. Build a function to remove an item from the list.
7. When a user removes an item from the list, the item is added back to the collection of items.
8. Build a toggle function that sorts the items in the collection and list alphabetically (A-Z) and vice versa (Z-A).
9. You must display the total sum of some piece of data from the list. (i.e. if you had a list of pokemon, you could total the number of common, rare and legendary pokemon in the list). You cannot total the number of items in the array, it must be a value from the data object.
10. The website must be built with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no third party css or js libraries).
11. The items retrieved from the API must be displayed in styled HTML. (i.e. if you were working with the pokeAPI you could display the data in a "card" design with the image, attack, hitpoints, etc).
12. The website must be mobile responsive across desktop, ipad/tablet and mobile phones.
